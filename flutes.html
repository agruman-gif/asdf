<h2> <font color="red"> <u>The flute is the highest voice in the woodwind section. Their range can go as high as the second highest C (C7) on the piano. </font> </u> </h1>

<h3> There are also auxiliary flutes, or supplementary flutes used in the orchestra that can be played by other flute players in the orchestra. These are important as they can add additional balance to the entire woodwind section. </h3>

These include 
<ul>
<li> The piccolo </li>
<li> The alto flute </li>
<li> The bass flute </li>
</ul>

<td> <font color="660066"> The alto flute is less common, but still more common than the bass flute. This instrument is <br/> used on rare occasions as not many composers write auxiliary parts for the bass flute. </td> </font>
